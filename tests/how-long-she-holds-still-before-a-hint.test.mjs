// HOW LONG SHE HAS TO HOLD STILL BEFORE A KEY HINT APPEARS.
//
// Five strips drawn at 0, 500, 700, 1200 and 2000ms were compared by hovering,
// and the standard 700ms that Qt and Radix use was chosen.
//
// Round one asked how fast the ink should come up, and the speed of the fade
// turned out to be the wrong control: what matters is how long you have to
// hold still before it appears at all. That is what every toolkit that ships
// this actually has, read out of their own source: Windows 500ms, GNOME 500ms,
// Qt 700ms, Radix 700ms.
//
// Three things here are worth a test rather than an eye.
//
//   THE WAIT IS THE CHOSEN NUMBER. It was 700 while the hint CHANGED the
//   component under the pointer. It went to 1500 when the hint became a plate
//   that arrives beside it (w-2f7fac6027), because hovering past controls kept
//   surfacing shortcuts by accident. The grace was 300, which is Radix's own
//   skipDelayDuration.
//
//   ONLY THE DRAWING WAITS. The row under the pointer is also the row R and E
//   act on, and that targeting is still instant. If the wait sat in front of
//   both, the keys would belong to a row the screen had said nothing about.
//
//   THE SECOND HINT COSTS NOTHING. Once one has appeared the window is awake,
//   and every hint after it arrives with no wait until the pointer has touched
//   nothing for the grace. That is what makes a wait this long livable: it is
//   paid once per visit rather than on every control she passes.
