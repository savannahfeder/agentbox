// SETTINGS HAS A SEARCH BOX, AND IT FINDS A SETTING BY THE WORD YOU WOULD USE
// (w-ccadd13c46, 2026-10-05).
//
// The settings screen was redone from scratch after it was called "pretty
// confusing to process and a bit visually unappealing", with Linear's settings
// as the reference, and the search box at the top of its sidebar was the part
// singled out: "I also like the search menu. I think that's a good idea."
//
// Before this there was no way to find a setting except by knowing which page
// it was filed under. Measured on the old screen: the permission mode, the
// accounts, the usage meters, agents at once, the memory switch, your own
// agents, the hints switch, diagnostics and the store path were all on one
// page called General, so nine unrelated answers had one door.
//
// What these tests hold: a setting is found by its own name and by the word a
// person would type for it ("dark", "log out", "ram"); a word only matches at
// the start of a word, so "ode" does not find "mode"; a page that is not on
// this Mac (Codex, Team) is never offered; and a project is found by its name.
